## 📝 Todo Local App

**Todo Local App** is a minimal task management tool designed for simplicity and privacy.
It allows you to quickly add, view, and remove tasks all stored locally in your browser using cookies or local storage.

No accounts. No cloud. Just your tasks, in your browser.

### 🔍 Why?

Because sometimes you just want to:

* Organize your daily tasks without syncing them to external servers.
* Keep things private by design.
* Delete tasks instantly, without a trace.

This app does exactly that no tracking, and no data leaving your device.


### 💡 How It Works

* All tasks are stored locally in your browser (via cookies or local storage).
* When you mark a task as done, it’s removed instantly.
* Everything runs entirely on the frontend using Next.js.


### 🔓 Open Source

The code is 100% open source and licensed under the MIT License.
You can view, modify, or self-host the project freely.
